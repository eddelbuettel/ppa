## PPA

### What is this

This is an informal and unofficial Personal Package Repository containing some
Debian package builds.

### How is it made

It draws from the sibbling source repositories here as _e.g._ [the minimal
AWS SDK for S3](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/pkg-aws-sdk-cpp-only-s3),
as well as its build dependencies. I may add other packages. Or not.

The binaries are made in the same [pbuilder](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/pbuilder/pbuilder.8.en.html)
setup used for all [my official Debian packages](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=edd@debian.org).

Note that for Ubuntu use I do have [two PPA repos on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~edd).

### License and copyrights

Everything is open source.

The AWS packages are all under Apache 2.0 licens, and coprighted Amazon.
